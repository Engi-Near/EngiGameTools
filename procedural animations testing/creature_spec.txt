CREATURE BODY SPECIFICATION

MAIN BODY PARTS:
1. Torso
   - Dimensions: 2 x 4 rectangle
   - Position: Center reference point
   - Connection points:
     * Bottom left + 1/8 width: Hind leg attachment
     * Bottom center: Middle leg attachment
     * Bottom right - 1/8 width: Front leg attachment
     * Lower left corner: Connects to abdomen
     * Top right corner: Connects to head

2. Abdomen
   - Dimensions: 3 x 3 rectangle
   - Joint: Upper right corner locks to torso's lower left corner

3. Head
   - Dimensions: 1 x 1 square
   - Joint: Bottom left corner locks to torso's top right corner

LEGS (3 identical structures):
Each leg consists of 3 segments:
- Upper segment
- Middle segment
- Lower segment

Leg Attachment Points:

2. Middle Leg: Center of torso's bottom edge
3. Front Leg: 7/8 distance from torso's bottom left corner

PHYSICS PROPERTIES:
- All joints should allow rotational movement
- Body parts should have appropriate mass distribution
- Gravity affects all components
- Collision detection between all body parts
